  abstract = "Team sports like ice hockey require high levels of performance in
              numerous physical characteristics such as strength, power, and
              endurance. As such, training is associated with a potential
              interference effect. The present study randomized well-trained
              ice hockey players into a block periodization group (BP; n = 8),
              focusing on the development of either strength and power or
              endurance on a weekly, undulating basis, and a traditional group
              (TRAD; n = 8), performing a mixed training model, with
              simultaneous focus of strength, power, and endurance training
              every week. During the 6-week intervention, the two groups
              performed equal volumes and intensities of both strength, power,
              and endurance training. BP led to larger improvements than TRAD
              in knee extension peak torque at 180° s-1 (6.6 $\pm$ 8.7 vs
              -4.2\% $\pm$ 6.3\%, respectively; P < 0.05) and maximal oxygen
              uptake (5.1 $\pm$ 3.3 vs 1.1\% $\pm$ 3.5\%, respectively; P <
              0.05). There was also a trend toward larger improvements in BP
              than TRAD in peak torque in knee extension at 60° s-1 (2.1 $\pm$
              2.5 vs -0.1\% $\pm$ 2.5\%, respectively; P < 0.1, effect size =

              size for all these variables compared to TRAD. The present study

               and may lead to compromised overall adaptation. Therefore, we
               investigated the effect of block training periodization on
               maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max) and parameters of exercise
               performance in elite junior alpine skiers. Six female and 15
               male athletes were assigned to high-intensity interval (IT, N =
               13) or control training groups (CT, N = 8). IT performed 15
               high-intensity aerobic interval (HIT) sessions in 11 days.
               Sessions were 4 x 4 min at 90-95\% of maximal heart rate
               separated by 3-min recovery periods. CT continued their
               conventionally mixed training, containing endurance and strength
               sessions. Before and 7 days after training, subjects performed a
               ramp incremental test followed by a high-intensity
               time-to-exhaustion (tlim) test both on a cycle ergometer, a 90-s
               high-box jump test as well as countermovement (CMJ) and squat
               jumps (SJ) on a force plate. IT significantly improved relative
               VO2max by 6.0\% (P < 0.01; male +7.5\%, female +2.1\%), relative
               peak power output by 5.5\% (P < 0.01) and power output at
               ventilatory threshold 2 by 9.6\% (P < 0.01). No changes occurred
               for these measures in CT. tlim remained unchanged in both
               groups. High-box jump performance was significantly improved in
               males of IT only (4.9\%, P < 0.05). Jump peak power (CMJ -4.8\%,
               SJ -4.1\%; P < 0.01), but not height decreased in IT only. For
               competitive alpine skiers, block periodization of HIT offers a
               promising way to efficiently improve VO2max and performance.

               studies in sports medicine and exercise science. We offer
               forthright advice on the following controversial or novel
               issues: using precision of estimation for inferences about
               population effects in preference to null-hypothesis testing,
               which is inadequate for assessing clinical or practical
               importance; justifying sample size via acceptable precision or
               confidence for clinical decisions rather than via adequate power
               for statistical significance; showing SD rather than SEM, to
               better communicate the magnitude of differences in means and
               nonuniformity of error; avoiding purely nonparametric analyses,
               which cannot provide inferences about magnitude and are
               unnecessary; using regression statistics in validity studies, in
               preference to the impractical and biased limits of agreement;
               making greater use of qualitative methods to enrich sample-based
               quantitative projects; and seeking ethics approval for public
               access to the depersonalized raw data of a study, to address the
               need for more scrutiny of research and better meta-analyses.
               Advice on less contentious issues includes the following: using
               covariates in linear models to adjust for confounders, to
               account for individual differences, and to identify potential
               mechanisms of an effect; using log transformation to deal with
               nonuniformity of effects and error; identifying and deleting
               outliers; presenting descriptive, effect, and inferential
               statistics in appropriate formats; and contending with bias
               arising from problems with sampling, assignment, blinding,
               measurement error, and researchers' prejudices. This article
               should advance the field by stimulating debate, promoting

  abstract  = "Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are considered the highest
               level of evidence to establish causal associations in clinical
               research. There are many RCT designs and features that can be

               become increasingly diverse as new methods have been proposed to
               evaluate increasingly complex scientific hypotheses. This
               article reviews the principles and general concepts behind many
               common RCT designs and introduces newer designs that have been
               proposed, such as adaptive and cluster randomized trials. A
               focus on the many choices for randomization within an RCT is
               described, along with their potential tradeoffs. To illustrate
               their diversity, examples of RCTs from the literature are
               provided. Statistical considerations, such as power and type I
               error rates, are discussed with the intention of providing
               practical guidance about how to specify study hypotheses that
               address the scientific question while being statistically
               appropriate. Finally, the freely available Consolidated

  abstract  = "Reliability refers to the reproducibility of values of a test,
               assay or other measurement in repeated trials on the same
               individuals. Better reliability implies better precision of
               single measurements and better tracking of changes in
               measurements in research or practical settings. The main
               measures of reliability are within-subject random variation,
               systematic change in the mean, and retest correlation. A simple,
               adaptable form of within-subject variation is the typical
               (standard) error of measurement: the standard deviation of an
               individual's repeated measurements. For many measurements in
               sports medicine and science, the typical error is best expressed
               as a coefficient of variation (percentage of the mean). A
               biased, more limited form of within-subject variation is the
               limits of agreement: the 95\% likely range of change of an
               individual's measurements between 2 trials. Systematic changes
               in the mean of a measure between consecutive trials represent
               such effects as learning, motivation or fatigue; these changes
               need to be eliminated from estimates of within-subject
               variation. Retest correlation is difficult to interpret, mainly
               because its value is sensitive to the heterogeneity of the
               sample of participants. Uses of reliability include
               decision-making when monitoring individuals, comparison of tests
               or equipment, estimation of sample size in experiments and
               estimation of the magnitude of individual differences in the
               response to a treatment. Reasonable precision for estimates of
               reliability requires approximately 50 study participants and at
               least 3 trials. Studies aimed at assessing variation in
               reliability between tests or equipment require complex designs
               and analyses that researchers seldom perform correctly. A wider
               understanding of reliability and adoption of the typical error
               as the standard measure of reliability would improve the
               assessment of tests and equipment in our disciplines.",

               between one or more independent variables and a dependent
               variable and is one of the most frequently used types of
               analysis in medical research. The aim of this article is to
               provide a brief theoretical and practical tutorial for
               neurosurgeons wishing to conduct or interpret regression
               analyses. METHODS AND RESULTS: Data preparation, univariable and
               multivariable analysis, choice of model, model requirements and
               assumptions are discussed, as essential prerequisites to any
               regression analysis. Four main types of regression techniques
               are presented: linear, logistic, multinomial logistic, and
               proportional odds logistic. To illustrate the applications of
               regression to real-world data and exemplify the concepts
               introduced, we used a previously reported data set of patients
               with intracranial aneurysms treated by microsurgical clip
               reconstruction at the Department of Neurosurgery of Erasmus MC
               University Medical Center Rotterdam, between January 2000 and
               January 2019. CONCLUSIONS: Regression analysis is a powerful and
               versatile instrument in data analysis. This material is intended
               as a starter for those wishing to critically interpret or
               perform regression analysis and we recommend multidisciplinary

  abstract = "Statistically underpowered studies can result in experimental
              failure even when all other experimental considerations have been
              addressed impeccably. In fMRI the combination of a large number
              of dependent variables, a relatively small number of observations
              (subjects), and a need to correct for multiple comparisons can
              decrease statistical power dramatically. This problem has been
              clearly addressed yet remains controversial-especially in regards
              to the expected effect sizes in fMRI, and especially for
              between-subjects effects such as group comparisons and
              brain-behavior correlations. We aimed to clarify the power
              problem by considering and contrasting two simulated scenarios of
              such possible brain-behavior correlations: weak diffuse effects
              and strong localized effects. Sampling from these scenarios shows
              that, particularly in the weak diffuse scenario, common sample
              sizes (n = 20-30) display extremely low statistical power, poorly
              represent the actual effects in the full sample, and show large
              variation on subsequent replications. Empirical data from the
              Human Connectome Project resembles the weak diffuse scenario much
              more than the localized strong scenario, which underscores the
              extent of the power problem for many studies. Possible solutions
              to the power problem include increasing the sample size, using
              less stringent thresholds, or focusing on a region-of-interest.
              However, these approaches are not always feasible and some have
              major drawbacks. The most prominent solutions that may help
              address the power problem include model-based (multivariate)

               type 4, and improving insulin sensitivity. Resistance training

              of resistance training volume for older adults is unclear in the
              current literature. In addition, the interactions between
              resistance training volume and program duration as well as
              physical health status remain to be determined when assessing
              physical function, muscle size and hypertrophy and muscle

              effective in improving physical function, lean body mass,
              lower-limb muscle hypertrophy and strength in older adults.
              Additionally, we examined whether effects were moderated by
              intervention duration (i.e. short term, < 20 weeks;
              medium-to-long term, $\geq$ 20 weeks) and physical health status
              (i.e. physically healthy, physically impaired, mixed physically
              healthy and physically impaired; PROSPERO identifier:
              CRD42023413209). METHODS: CINAHL, Embase, LILACS, PubMed, Scielo,
              SPORTDiscus and Web of Science databases were searched up to
              April 2023. Eligible randomised trials examined the effects of
              supervised resistance training in older adults (i.e. $\geq$ 60
              years). Resistance training programs were categorised as low
              (LVRT), moderate (MVRT) and high volume (HVRT) on the basis of
              terciles of prescribed weekly resistance training volume (i.e.
              product of frequency, number of exercises and number of sets) for
              full- and lower-body training. The primary outcomes for this
              review were physical function measured by fast walking speed,
              timed up and go and 6-min walking tests; lean body mass and
              lower-body muscle hypertrophy; and lower-body muscle strength
              measured by knee extension and leg press one-repetition maximum
              (1-RM), isometric muscle strength and isokinetic torque. A
              random-effects network meta-analysis was undertaken to examine
              the effects of different resistance training volumes on the
              outcomes of interest. RESULTS: We included a total of 161
              articles describing 151 trials (n = 6306). LVRT was the most
              effective for improving timed up and go [- 1.20 standardised mean
              difference (SMD), 95\% confidence interval (95\% CI): - 1.57 to -
              0.82], 6-min walk test (1.03 SMD, 95\% CI: 0.33-1.73), lean body
              mass (0.25 SMD, 95\% CI: 0.10-0.40) and muscle hypertrophy (0.40
              SMD, 95\% CI: 0.25-0.54). Both MVRT and HVRT were the most
              effective for improving lower-limb strength, while only HVRT was
              effective in increasing fast walking speed (0.40 SMD, 95\% CI: -
              0.57 to 0.14). Regarding the moderators, our results were
              independent of program duration and mainly observed for healthy
              older adults, while evidence was limited for those who were
              physically impaired. CONCLUSIONS: A low resistance training
              volume can substantially improve healthy older adults' physical
              function and benefits lean mass and muscle size independently of
              program duration, while a higher volume seems to be necessary for
              achieving greater improvements in muscle strength. A low volume
              of resistance training should be recommended in future exercise
              guidelines, particularly for physically healthy older adults
              targeting healthy ageing.",

               time-to-exhaustion (tlim) test both on a cycle ergometer, a 90-s
               high-box jump test as well as countermovement (CMJ) and squat
               jumps (SJ) on a force plate. IT significantly improved relative
               VO2max by 6.0\% (P < 0.01; male +7.5\%, female +2.1\%), relative
               peak power output by 5.5\% (P < 0.01) and power output at
               ventilatory threshold 2 by 9.6\% (P < 0.01). No changes occurred
               for these measures in CT. tlim remained unchanged in both
               groups. High-box jump performance was significantly improved in
               males of IT only (4.9\%, P < 0.05). Jump peak power (CMJ -4.8\%,
               SJ -4.1\%; P < 0.01), but not height decreased in IT only. For
               competitive alpine skiers, block periodization of HIT offers a
               promising way to efficiently improve VO2max and performance.

               resource for sample-based studies, meta-analyses, and case
               studies in sports medicine and exercise science. We offer
               forthright advice on the following controversial or novel
               issues: using precision of estimation for inferences about
               population effects in preference to null-hypothesis testing,
               which is inadequate for assessing clinical or practical
               importance; justifying sample size via acceptable precision or
               confidence for clinical decisions rather than via adequate power
               for statistical significance; showing SD rather than SEM, to
               better communicate the magnitude of differences in means and
               nonuniformity of error; avoiding purely nonparametric analyses,
               which cannot provide inferences about magnitude and are
               unnecessary; using regression statistics in validity studies, in
               preference to the impractical and biased limits of agreement;
               making greater use of qualitative methods to enrich sample-based
               quantitative projects; and seeking ethics approval for public
               access to the depersonalized raw data of a study, to address the
               need for more scrutiny of research and better meta-analyses.
               Advice on less contentious issues includes the following: using
               covariates in linear models to adjust for confounders, to
               account for individual differences, and to identify potential
               mechanisms of an effect; using log transformation to deal with
               nonuniformity of effects and error; identifying and deleting
               outliers; presenting descriptive, effect, and inferential
               statistics in appropriate formats; and contending with bias
               arising from problems with sampling, assignment, blinding,
               measurement error, and researchers' prejudices. This article
               should advance the field by stimulating debate, promoting
               innovative approaches, and serving as a useful checklist for

  abstract  = "Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are considered the highest
               level of evidence to establish causal associations in clinical
               research. There are many RCT designs and features that can be
               selected to address a research hypothesis. Designs of RCTs have
               become increasingly diverse as new methods have been proposed to
               evaluate increasingly complex scientific hypotheses. This
               article reviews the principles and general concepts behind many
               common RCT designs and introduces newer designs that have been
               proposed, such as adaptive and cluster randomized trials. A
               focus on the many choices for randomization within an RCT is
               described, along with their potential tradeoffs. To illustrate
               their diversity, examples of RCTs from the literature are
               provided. Statistical considerations, such as power and type I
               error rates, are discussed with the intention of providing
               practical guidance about how to specify study hypotheses that
               address the scientific question while being statistically
               appropriate. Finally, the freely available Consolidated
               Standards of Reporting Trials guidelines and US Food and Drug

  author    = "Hopkins, W G",
  abstract  = "Reliability refers to the reproducibility of values of a test,
               assay or other measurement in repeated trials on the same
               individuals. Better reliability implies better precision of
               single measurements and better tracking of changes in
               measurements in research or practical settings. The main
               measures of reliability are within-subject random variation,
               systematic change in the mean, and retest correlation. A simple,
               adaptable form of within-subject variation is the typical
               (standard) error of measurement: the standard deviation of an
               individual's repeated measurements. For many measurements in
               sports medicine and science, the typical error is best expressed
               as a coefficient of variation (percentage of the mean). A
               biased, more limited form of within-subject variation is the
               limits of agreement: the 95\% likely range of change of an
               individual's measurements between 2 trials. Systematic changes
               in the mean of a measure between consecutive trials represent
               such effects as learning, motivation or fatigue; these changes
               need to be eliminated from estimates of within-subject
               variation. Retest correlation is difficult to interpret, mainly
               because its value is sensitive to the heterogeneity of the
               sample of participants. Uses of reliability include
               decision-making when monitoring individuals, comparison of tests
               or equipment, estimation of sample size in experiments and
               estimation of the magnitude of individual differences in the
               response to a treatment. Reasonable precision for estimates of
               reliability requires approximately 50 study participants and at
               least 3 trials. Studies aimed at assessing variation in
               reliability between tests or equipment require complex designs
               and analyses that researchers seldom perform correctly. A wider
               understanding of reliability and adoption of the typical error
               as the standard measure of reliability would improve the
               assessment of tests and equipment in our disciplines.",

               overlooked confounding variables",
  author    = "Halperin, Israel and Pyne, David B and Martin, David T",
  abstract  = "Internal validity refers to the degree of control exerted over
               potential confounding variables to reduce alternative
               explanations for the effects of various treatments. In exercise
               and sports-science research and routine testing, internal
               validity is commonly achieved by controlling variables such as
               exercise and warm-up protocols, prior training, nutritional
               intake before testing, ambient temperature, time of testing,
               hours of sleep, age, and gender. However, a number of other
               potential confounding variables often do not receive adequate
               attention in sports physiology and performance research. These
               confounding variables include instructions on how to perform the
               test, volume and frequency of verbal encouragement, knowledge of
               exercise endpoint, number and gender of observers in the room,
               influence of music played before and during testing, and the
               effects of mental fatigue on performance. In this review the
               authors discuss these variables in relation to common testing
               environments in exercise and sports science and present some
               recommendations with the goal of reducing possible threats to
               internal validity.",

@ARTICLE{Lunt,
  title     = "Introduction to statistical modelling 2: categorical variables
               and interactions in linear regression",
  author    = "Lunt, Mark",
  abstract  = "In the first article in this series we explored the use of
               linear regression to predict an outcome variable from a number
               of predictive factors. It assumed that the predictive factors
               were measured on an interval scale. However, this article shows
               how categorical variables can also be included in a linear
               regression model, enabling predictions to be made separately for
               different groups and allowing for testing the hypothesis that
               the outcome differs between groups. The use of interaction terms
               to measure whether the effect of a particular predictor variable
               differs between groups is also explained. An alternative
               approach to testing the difference between groups of the effect
               of a given predictor, which consists of measuring the effect in
               each group separately and seeing whether the statistical
               significance differs between the groups, is shown to be
               misleading.",

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Regression analysis quantifies the relationships
               between one or more independent variables and a dependent
               variable and is one of the most frequently used types of
               analysis in medical research. The aim of this article is to
               provide a brief theoretical and practical tutorial for
               neurosurgeons wishing to conduct or interpret regression
               analyses. METHODS AND RESULTS: Data preparation, univariable and
               multivariable analysis, choice of model, model requirements and
               assumptions are discussed, as essential prerequisites to any
               regression analysis. Four main types of regression techniques
               are presented: linear, logistic, multinomial logistic, and
               proportional odds logistic. To illustrate the applications of
               regression to real-world data and exemplify the concepts
               introduced, we used a previously reported data set of patients
               with intracranial aneurysms treated by microsurgical clip
               reconstruction at the Department of Neurosurgery of Erasmus MC
               University Medical Center Rotterdam, between January 2000 and
               January 2019. CONCLUSIONS: Regression analysis is a powerful and
               versatile instrument in data analysis. This material is intended
               as a starter for those wishing to critically interpret or
               perform regression analysis and we recommend multidisciplinary
               collaborations with trained methodologists, statisticians, or
               epidemiologists.",

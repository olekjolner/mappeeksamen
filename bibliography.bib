  author    = "Hopkins, W G",
  abstract  = "Reliability refers to the reproducibility of values of a test,
               assay or other measurement in repeated trials on the same
               individuals. Better reliability implies better precision of
               single measurements and better tracking of changes in
               measurements in research or practical settings. The main
               measures of reliability are within-subject random variation,
               systematic change in the mean, and retest correlation. A simple,
               adaptable form of within-subject variation is the typical
               (standard) error of measurement: the standard deviation of an
               individual's repeated measurements. For many measurements in
               sports medicine and science, the typical error is best expressed
               as a coefficient of variation (percentage of the mean). A
               biased, more limited form of within-subject variation is the
               limits of agreement: the 95\% likely range of change of an
               individual's measurements between 2 trials. Systematic changes
               in the mean of a measure between consecutive trials represent
               such effects as learning, motivation or fatigue; these changes
               need to be eliminated from estimates of within-subject
               variation. Retest correlation is difficult to interpret, mainly
               because its value is sensitive to the heterogeneity of the
               sample of participants. Uses of reliability include
               decision-making when monitoring individuals, comparison of tests
               or equipment, estimation of sample size in experiments and
               estimation of the magnitude of individual differences in the
               response to a treatment. Reasonable precision for estimates of
               reliability requires approximately 50 study participants and at
               least 3 trials. Studies aimed at assessing variation in
               reliability between tests or equipment require complex designs
               and analyses that researchers seldom perform correctly. A wider
               understanding of reliability and adoption of the typical error
               as the standard measure of reliability would improve the
               assessment of tests and equipment in our disciplines.",

@ARTICLE{Halperin,
  title     = "Threats to internal validity in exercise science: a review of
               overlooked confounding variables",
  author    = "Halperin, Israel and Pyne, David B and Martin, David T",
  abstract  = "Internal validity refers to the degree of control exerted over
               potential confounding variables to reduce alternative
               explanations for the effects of various treatments. In exercise
               and sports-science research and routine testing, internal
               validity is commonly achieved by controlling variables such as
               exercise and warm-up protocols, prior training, nutritional
               intake before testing, ambient temperature, time of testing,
               hours of sleep, age, and gender. However, a number of other
               potential confounding variables often do not receive adequate
               attention in sports physiology and performance research. These
               confounding variables include instructions on how to perform the
               test, volume and frequency of verbal encouragement, knowledge of
               exercise endpoint, number and gender of observers in the room,
               influence of music played before and during testing, and the
               effects of mental fatigue on performance. In this review the
               authors discuss these variables in relation to common testing
               environments in exercise and sports science and present some
               recommendations with the goal of reducing possible threats to
               internal validity.",

# Assignment 1: Reliability and tools for reproducible data science {#assignment1}

The purpose of this assignment is to present estimates of reliability of measures collected in the physiology lab. A second purpose is to use tools for reproducible data science. The report that you are expected to hand in therefore has some strict requirements in its format (see [assignment description](https://dhammarstrom.github.io/quant-methods-workshops/assignment-1.html)). The assignment is a group assignment and at least three students are expected to contribute to each report.

## Elements of the report

**Importantly, the report should contain:**

- At least one table (created from your data)
- At least one figure (created from your data), and
- data presented in the text.
- The report should use a bibliography file to manage references.
